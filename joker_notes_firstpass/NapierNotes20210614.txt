-Decoders: 
	KF0: TrainOnline_Cortical_KalmanFilter_Multi('Joker','',4,false,[2,4],32,0,good_chans_SBP,good_chans_SBP,1,{'act_thresh',1},true);
	
	RF0: TrainOnline_Cortical_KalmanFilterReFIT_Multi('Joker','',5,5,false,[2,4],32,[0,0],xpcA,xpcW,good_chans_SBP,good_chans_SBP,1,{[], []},true);
	RF1: TrainOnline_Cortical_KalmanFilterReFIT_Multi('Joker','',5,6,false,[2,4],32,[0,0],xpcA,xpcW,good_chans_SBP,good_chans_SBP,1,{[], []},true);

-Runs:
	Run 1: calibration
	Run 2: Warm up
	Run 3: Training TS34 - forgot to log into Phoenix and Deadpool
	Run 4: Training TS34 (DVR video 1; oops, recorded to the beginning of run 5) - 5.1 bps, might need another training set
	Run 5: KF0 SBP Vint=0 (DVR video 2, started around trial 165): Looks like a good first decoder
	Run 6: RF0 SBP Vint=0 (DVR video 3, started around trial 46): Very smooth, but pretty slow velocities, might try one more RF but it might slow even more. Decoder seems extension biased.
	Run 7: RF1 SBP Vint=0 (DVR video 4, started around trial 107): Glad I trained another RF, this is much better, 2.5bps at the peak
	
	NERVE BLOCK - 2mL each nerve
	Blocks delivered between 9:30 and 9:50am
	
	Run 8: RF1 SBP Vint=0 (DVR video 5, started a few minutes before): Working great! Went back to human side, so starting new run.
	Run 9: RF1 SBP Vint=0 (DVR video 5): Started with a few hand control trials, block may still be kicking in. His hand is weak, but he's still able to do MC 350 trials in. Having trouble extending with brain control late 860s. Had to reset decoder, but working afterward. Stops working later, maybe lost motivation. There's still juice. Index keeps getting stuck at full flexion. Ignore trials after 850.
