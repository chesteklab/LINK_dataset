-Runs:
	Run 1: Calibration
	Run 2: 400 Trials - Training
	Run 3: 100 Trials - Validation
	Run 4-6: Wrong Bin size
	Run 7: 100 Trials - 3.5k decoder - lots of failures
	Run 8: 65 Trials - 6.9k  decoder - had to stop because he just wasn't getting any
	Run 9: 100 Trials - new 3.5k decoder - lots of fails
	Run 10-11: Idx seems stuck, went to fix (outof time=`1
	
-Notes:
	- first set of decoders had very low correlations relative to what we normally see
	- second set still not great, seems maybe better?
	- for either one it seems like it's either it works and is decently fast or it doesnt work at all.
