-Runs:
	Run 1: Calibration
	Run 2: Warm-up: 150 (flogger crash at 128, probably did >150)
	Run 3: Training: 400 
	Run 4: Validation: 100 - Followed by a break for network training
	Run 5: NN - 3.5k - 100 Trials - failed a lot
	Run 6: Tried again, failed a lot
	Run 7: Disconnected EMG and tried again
	Run 8: Training: 400 - trying with EMG disconnected
	Run 9: Validation: 100
	Run 10: 3.5k NN - ~200 Trials: better, need to compare to a day where I do the same thing w/out disconnecting EMG
	Run 11: 6.5k NN - not so good
	
-Notes:
	making sure EMG isn't affecting things
	- need to repeat today but leaving emg connected
