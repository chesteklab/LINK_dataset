- Goals: Testing Mote Simulator/Interval Decoding

- Experiment:  Joey, Sam

- Recording Start Time: 9:30 am
- Recording Stop Time:  1:00 pm

- xPC Model: Rig_main_Cortical_SBP_Spikes_motePackets8, switched back to v6 around run 4
- Recorded Array: Motor (Patient Cable) + EMG (CPD via CPA)
- Data recorded: Spikes (250Hz highpass, RMS -4.5) + Raw + 2kSps 300-1000HzBPas continuous
- Drink: Apple Juice

- Params: 
	* Movement Mask: [0,1,0,1,0]
	* Target Hold Time (OL/CL): 750/500 online
	* Target Scaling(OL/CL): 100
	* Juice Time: 100
	* Trial Timeout: 10000
	* Auto Juice: 0
   	* Target Pos Style (OL/CL): 34
	* Visualization Style: MRS

-Decoders: 
	KF0: TrainOnline_Cortical_KalmanFilter_Multi_MoteIntervals('Joker','',1,false,[2,4],32,0,good_chans_SBP,good_chans_SBP,1,{'act_thresh',1},true, 1,1);
	KF1: TrainOnline_Cortical_KalmanFilter_Multi_MoteIntervals('Joker','',1,false,[2,4],50,0,good_chans_SBP,good_chans_SBP,1,{'act_thresh',1},true, 1,1);
	KF2: TrainOnline_Cortical_KalmanFilter_Multi_MoteIntervals('Joker','',12,false,[2,4],32,0,good_chans_SBP,good_chans_SBP,1,{'act_thresh',1},true, 3,1);
	
-Runs:
	(calibration and first run was in the 'Test' folder. Switched to Joker)
	Run 1: training TS-34 (400 trials). Having a little trouble reaching index extension
	Run 2: KF0 - out of range
	Run 3-11: testing, trying to get decoder working
	Run 12: 100 trials training
	Run 13: KF2 - not even SBP decoder is working (totally maxed out)
	Run 14: KF2 on the normal xpc model - KF2 works! which means the mote data collection/training works, but not real time decoder
	...
	Run 17: switched to 5v2_2 - looks like working, getting actual decode values for both sbp/intervals. 
	
	
-Notes:
	good_chans_SBP = [1:9,11,13,15,17,23,24,33,35,37:40,43,45:47,49:53,55:60,62,64,65,67:69,71:76,78:88,90:92,95,96];
