-Runs:
	Run 1: Calibration
	Run 2: TS34 - normal
	Run 3: TS34 - springs 2/4
	Run 4: TS34 - spring -/4
	Run 5: TS34 - spring 2/- - this one is very difficult for him. He stopped trying it
	Run 6: TS34 - spring 1/
	Run 7: TS34 - springs 1/2
	Run 8: TS34 - spring 2/- - gave a few minutes for a break and increased juice to 110 - also turned on repeat target after failure because he started skipping IF. Let him try for 10 minutes and then stopped. 
	Run 9: TS34 - normal
