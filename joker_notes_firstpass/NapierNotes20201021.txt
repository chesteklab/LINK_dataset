-Runs:
	Run 1: Calibration
	Run 2: TS 34 training
	Run 3: KF0, TS 34, changed hold time to 500 at trial 14; decoder wasnt working well, stopped at trial 26
	Run 4: KF1, TS 34, still not a very good decoder but not getting stuck. Velocity controlled integration type 2 to start (output = integrated velocity but position in KF state is not). He can't flex his MRP fully. Somewhere in the middle of the run he had a good string of all targets. What changed?
	Run 5: KF1, TS 34, changed Velocity controlled integration type to 1 (position control). Still not good at flexing MRP.
	Run 6: KF1, TS 34, changed Velocity controlled integration type to 0 (ouput and position in state vector are integrated velocity). MRP flex seems to be better, bot not great.
	Run 7: KF1, TS 34, turned off velocity integration alltogether. Took a bit for close loop to work well, maybe around trial 30.
	Run 8: KF1, TS 34, back to velocity integration type 2.
	Run 9: KF1, TS 34, back to velocity integration type 1. Having trouble with MRP flex again.
	Run 10: KF1, TS 34, back to velocity integration type 0. MRP flex still not great. Starting to get antsy, lots of noise is showing up on the array when he can't hit a target. Working well when he can though.
	Run 11: KF1, TS 34, back to no velocity integration. Can barely use it near the end.
	Run 12: TS34 training.
	Run 13: KF2 SBP: integration type 0. Better than it was. Quite a bit of orbiting. Does not have the MRS flexion problems. Having trouble with far flexions later.
	Run 14: KF2 SBP: integration type 1. Also pretty good. Problems might have been from delay between training and testing. Out of juice around 190.
	
-Notes:
	good_chans_SBP = [1:9,11,13,15,17,23,24,33,35,37:40,43,45:47,49:53,55:60,62,64,65,67:69,71:76,78:88,90,92,95,96];	% 91 had a weird artifact along with spikes, but the artifact was very frequent so we can't use that channel
