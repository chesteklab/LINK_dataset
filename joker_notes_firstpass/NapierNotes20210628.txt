-Decoders: 
	KF0: TrainOnline_Cortical_KalmanFilter_Multi('Joker','',2,false,[2,4],32,0,good_chans_SBP,good_chans_SBP,1,{'act_thresh',1},true);
	
	RF0: TrainOnline_Cortical_KalmanFilterReFIT_Multi('Joker','',3,3,false,[2,4],32,[0,0],xpcA,xpcW,good_chans_SBP,good_chans_SBP,1,{[], []},true);

-Runs:
	Run 1: calibration
	Run 2: Training TS34 
	Run 3: KF0 SBP (DVR video 1) - looks like a good first decoder. 
	Run 4: TS 34 - a few hand control trials while model trains to have dvr of hand control. 260 SBP trials, 20 TCFR trials starting around 260
	Run 5: RF0 - TS 34 - Still on DVR video 1 - decoder is working well. Bit rate > 2, velocities a little low but can stop well. Peaked around 2.4 bps
	
	Blocks delivered between 9:45 and 10:10am. Injection end at 10:07, unable to grab craisins by 10:14. 
	NERVE BLOCK - 4.5-5ml total between the three nerves. 
	
	Run 6: RF0 - TS 34 - started with a few hand control trials - was able to slightly extend fingers to center. Started online - can get some targets but very slow and shakey. Block seems to be working very well. Working more or less so went back to the other side, starting new run. 
	Run 7: RF0 - TS 34 - started with hand control - twitched MRS a little, but could not get targets. Turned on decode and it's working still - bit rates around 1 bps still. 
	
	Training ReFIT on run 7 to see if we can get good performance while hand is blocked
	Run 8: RF1 - TS 34 - still can't do hand control at start. Brain control seems much faster. Started adding more hand control near the end. Did not successfully acquire any hand control targets other than center.


-Notes:
	good_chans_SBP = [1:9,11,13,15,17,23,24,33,35,37:40,43,45:47,49:53,55:60,62,64,65,67:69,71:76,78:88,90:92,95,96]; 
	Was not recording during calibration. 
	Preblock recording started with run 2
	Postblock recording started with run 6
