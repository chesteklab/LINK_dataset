-Decoders: 
	KF0: TrainOnline_Cortical_KalmanFilter_Multi('Joker','',4,false,[2,4],50,0,good_chans_SBP,good_chans_SBP,1,{'act_thresh',1},true);
	KF1: TrainOnline_Cortical_KalmanFilter_Multi('Joker','',5,false,[2,4],50,0,good_chans_SBP,good_chans_SBP,1,{'act_thresh',1},true);

	
-Runs:
	Run 1: Calibration
	Run 2: TS34 - 250 trials
	Run 3: TS34 - training set 400 trials - looks like he got finger out of stanchion. 
	Run 4: TS34 - training set with springs 2/4 - 300 trials
	Run 5: TS34 - normal training set. Around trial 100 he got his finger out again. 
	Run 6: KF1 - TS34 - negligeable spring constant
	Run 7: KF1 - TS34 - k=.00001. Mostly gets middle and extension targets. Can get some flexion but MRS flexion seems difficult. ABout 100 trials
	Run 8: KF1 - TS34 - k=.0000075. Looked better to start. Difficulty flexing MRS again. 
	Run 9: KF1 - TS34 - k=.0000125
	Run 10: KF0 - TS34 - k is negligeable. Decoder is a bit difficult to use. 
	Run 11: KF0 - TS34 - k=0.00001. Started off very well but then couldn't use the decoder again. 
	Run 12: KF1 - TS34 - still works well
