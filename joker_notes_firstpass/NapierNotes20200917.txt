	KF0: TrainOnline_Cortical_KalmanFilter_Multi('Joker','',2,false,[2,4],50,0,good_chans_SBP,good_chans_SBP,1,{'act_thresh',1},true);
	KF3: TrainOnline_Cortical_KalmanFilter_Multi('Joker','',2,false,[2,4],32,0,good_chans_SBP,good_chans_SBP,1,{'act_thresh',1},true);
	RF0: TrainOnline_Cortical_KalmanFilterReFIT_Multi('Joker','',4,3,0,[2,4],50,xpcBinLag,xpcA,xpcW,good_chans_SBP,good_chans_SBP, 1, {[], []}, true);

	RF2: TrainOnline_Cortical_KalmanFilterReFIT_Multi('Joker','',8,7,0,[2,4],32,xpcBinLag,xpcA,xpcW,good_chans_SBP,good_chans_SBP, 1, {[], []}, true);

-Runs:
	Run 1: Calibration.
	Neural data recording started here
	Run 2: TS29 training. FL crashed, so deleting the final trial before training.
	Run 3: TS36, KF0 SBP: Having trouble holding the positions. Can often get to the target, but oscillations bring the fingers out of them. Fairly low success rate too.
	Run 4: Forgot to do TCR, so KF0 TCR for a few trials, which isn't really working at all.
	Run 5: RF0 SBP on TS36. Less oscillation, but having trouble holding the targets. In the end, about the same performance.
	Run 6: RF1 SBP on TS36. RFKF with unsuccessful trials included for training. Looked a bit better to start, but overall seems to be about the same performance.
	Run 7: KF3 SBP on TS36. 32ms bin size. Success rate is higher, but bit rate is about the same.
	Run 8: KF3 TCR on TS36. Stuck at full flexion.
	Run 9: RF2 SBP on TS36. Seems about the same as the other RFs. Not much improvement. May be worse than the KF actually.
	Run 10: RF3 SBP on TS36. RFKF with unsuccessful trials included for training. Looks about the same.
	
-Notes:
	Started neural data recording between run 1 and run 2 today.

	good_chans_SBP = [1:9,11,13,15,17,23,24,33,35,37:40,43,45:47,49:53,55:60,62,64,65,67:69,71:76,78:88,90:92,95,96];

	Spike and LFP data referenced to Channel 14, no additional grounds connected.
