-Decoders:

		
-Runs:
	Run 1: Calibration
	Run 2: TS 29 - 147 Trials, warm-up, following w a break
	Run 3: TS 29 - 400 Trials - Training - segfault file logger at 392
	Run 4: TS 29 - 400 Trials - Training (again)
	Run 5: TS 29 - 100 Trials - Validation - actually~120
	Run 6: TS 29 - 100 Trials - Training KF - actually ~130, followed by break while training network
	Run 7: NNKF broke when turning on, debugging
	Run 8: NNKF w/ KF on - not really working, definitely has some control but then gets pulled up - need to see how it's working/if it's working correctly in all circumstances
	Run 9: NNKF w/ KF off - even with no gain/offset definitely has some control
	Run 10: NNKF w/ KF on again
	
	
-Notes:
	- still need to determine if 3 runs or 2 runs is best. 
	- filelogger sefgaulted 
	good_chans_SBP = [1:9,11,13,15,17,23,24,33,35,37:40,43,45:47,49:53,55:60,62,64,65,67:69,71:76,78:88,90:92,95,96];
	
	- got it running by run 8, some debugging necesarry
		- updated onlinedecoders, simulink_connect_v2, generateOnlineSBPV4 - make sure to put each on the SVN.
		
	Maybe no covariance between velocities is best. will need to try offline and online.
