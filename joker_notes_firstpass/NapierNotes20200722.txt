- Goals: Spring dataset and online trials with the current setup.

- Experiment: Matt M and Sam

- Recording Start Time: 10:50 am
- Recording Stop Time: 1:00 pm

- xPC Model: Rig_main_Cortical_SBP_Spikes_CAR
- Recorded Array: Motor (Patient Cable)
- Data recorded: Spikes (250Hz highpass, RMS -4.5) + Raw + 2kSps 300-1000HzBPas continuous
- Drink: Apple Juice

- Params: 
	* Movement Mask: [0,1,0,1,0]
	* Target Hold Time (OL/CL): 750 (training)
	* Target Scaling(OL/CL): 100
	* Juice Time: 100
	* Trial Timeout: 10000
	* Auto Juice: 0
	* Target Pos Style: 29,34
	* Visualization Style: MRP
	
-Decoders: 
	KF0: TrainOnline_Cortical_KalmanFilter_Multi('Joker','',3,false,[2,4],32,0,goodChans,goodChans,1,{'act_thresh',1},true); % normal decoder
	KF1: TrainOnline_Cortical_KalmanFilter_Multi('Joker','',5,false,[2,4],32,0,goodChans,goodChans,1,{'act_thresh',1},true); % spring decoder
	
	
-Runs:
	Run 1: Calibration
	Run 2: TS 29 - looks like everything is working. Grabbed 200 trials. 
	Run 3: TS 34 - training set after a short break. 350 trials.
	Run 4: Calibration after putting springs in. No change.
	Run 5: TS 34 - with springs. 350 trials.
	Run 6: TS 34 - without springs. 350 trials.
	Run 7: TS 34 - testing to see if he's still motivated because I had KF1 loaded instead of KF0. 
	Run 8: KF0 - TS 34 - Start online on trial 10. Decoder isn't working very well. Can't seem to move his index finger very well. Left on for 170 trials online, lots of failed trials though. 
	Run 9: KF1 - TS 34 - Start online on trial 15. Decoder is useable at least
	Run 10: KF0 - TS 34 - did not magically get better. It looks like the fingers are shifted closed like theres an offset from something like a changing base activity level.
	Run 11: TS 34 - Grabbing a run to compare how the activity is changing over time. Why was KF0 so bad.... 475 trials
	
Notes
		goodChans = [1,3:7,9,11,15:19,33,35,37:41,49:51,53,58:62,65,67:69,71:76,78:88,90:92]; %These have some spiking
		*MJM 2022-02-04 - Added Models used folder because some things didn't save to the server on this day and they were sitting on the desktop.
