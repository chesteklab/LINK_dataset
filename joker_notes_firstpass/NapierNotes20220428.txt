- Goals: Getting familiar with pybmi
 
- Experimenters: Hisham, Eric

- Recording Start Time: 10:55 am
- Recording Stop Time:  11:30 am

- xPC Model: Rig_main_Cortical_Parasite
- Recorded Array: Motor (Patient Cable)
- Data recorded: Spikes (250Hz highpass, RMS -4.5) + 2kSps 300-1000HzBPas continuous
- Drink: Apple Juice

- Params: 
	* Movement Mask: [0,1,0,1,0]
	* Target Hold Time (OL/CL): 750
	* Target Scaling(OL/CL): 100
	* Juice Time: 90
	* Trial Timeout: 10000
	* Auto Juice: 0
   	* Target Pos Style (OL/CL): 29
	* Visualization Style: MRP
	
-Decoders:	
	NN0 - trained w/ pybmi
	NN1 - trained w/pybmi (tri redis)
-Runs:
	Run 0: Filelogger had been restarted night before and missed that it was not running. Contained calibration + warm-up + 5 min break
	Run 1: Training 400, TS29
	Run 2: Validation 100, TS29 (had accidentally left it running too long, trimmed it down)
	~training break~
	
	Run 3: Debugging and getting NN running with pybmi.
	Run 4: NN0 run. In the meantime retraining NN1, testing .npy zstruct and tri redist. 330 trials
	run 5: NN1 run. tri redis doesnt seem to be helping all that much tbh. could be time effects too. switched back to nn0 around 75-80, wasnt great either
	
-Notes:
	*Probably need to update logic on ZStructTranslator so that if no file exists, creates one instead of just saying no.
