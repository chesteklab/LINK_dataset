-Runs:
	Run 1: Calibration
	Run 2: TS35 - Normal, Matt was in the rig for the first ~30 trials.
	Run 3: TS35 - Spring 4 on MRS, no spring on index. Difficult for him at first.
	Run 4: He got hand out of stanchion
	Run 5: Recalibrated
	Run 6: TS 35 - Spring 2 on index - either not strong enough or not motivated enough. The stanchion seems to be sticking. Couldn't figure out how to get it to stop.
	Run 7: TS 35 - Normal. Having a lot of trouble doing index flexion. EMG channel 5 came back during this run and channel 9 went away. Won't do index flexion MRP extension

	
-Notes:
	Had referencing issues in the neural data to start. Cleaning the patient cable/pedestal and plugging in the EMG cleaned up most common noise. ***Exception is that neural channel 1 is looking disconnected.*** 
	On the EMG side, most channels look normal except FCU (9) has a signal today and FDPi(proximal - 5) does not have a signal. 
	
	Channel 5 came back part way through
