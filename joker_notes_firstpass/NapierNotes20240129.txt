-Runs:	
	Run 1: calibration + practice. ~200 trials.
	Run 2: TS34 1000 trials. Bitrate ~4.4
	-- 3 min break
	Run 3: TS29 1000 trials. Bitrate ~3.5, by trial 650 he's skipping some of the splits.
	Run 4: TS39. 750 trials and he stopped trying. He ran out of juice.
	
Summary:
	


TODO:
	



Notes:	
	Huge juicer artifact on all channels on the neural data
	Channel 38 had an actual spike today. It was the only apparent one.
