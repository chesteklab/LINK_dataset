-Runs:
	Run 1: Calibration + 130 trials TS29 warmup + 5 min break
	Run 2: TS29 - Normal 600 Trials
	Run 3: TS29 - Spring 600 Trials
	Run 4: TS29 - SprWrt 600 Trials *note: took a little bit longer to setup than normal->spring
	Run 5: TS29 - Wrist  185 Trials. Around 130 took a break. stopped at 180
	Run 6: TS29 - 25 trials. stopped to go recalibrate
	Run 7: Calibration
	Run 8: TS29 Wrist 300 Trials. Around 130 adjust MRP range slightly. Trouble with MRP extension
	Run 9: TS29 Wrist 120 Trials. Adjusted MRP range again.
-Notes:
	- some noise debugging
	- small breaks between each run. (For setting up contexts and trying to mitigate fatigue)
	- add normal at the end
	- may have been getting tired with the wrist trials.
