-Runs:
	Run 1: Calibration
	Run 2: TS35 - Normal, ~250 trials, then noticed we didn't start a new recording session after testing sensory array impedance
	Run 3: TS35 - Normal, ~800 trials
	Run 4: TS29 - Normal, ~350 trials
	Run 5: TS35 - Wrist flexed, ~800 trials
	Run 6: TS29 - Wrist flexed, pulled his hand out of the stanchion.
	Run 7: TS29 - Wrist flexed, with Matt back to fix his hand and make sure he does the task, ~400 trials
	Run 8: TS35 - Normal, ~850 trials
	Run 9: TS29 - Normal, ~350 trials

	
-Notes:
We took impedances today but forgot to hit new session when we started the recording for the motor array. It did create a new folder for motor array but just in case something gets messed up I decided to stop run 2, stop recording, and create new sessions for both the CPD and Cerebus at about 10:12.
