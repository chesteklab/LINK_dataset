-Runs:
	Run 1: Calibration
	Run 2: TS34 - No springs, ~500 trials
	Run 3: TS34 - Springs, started run, Matt accidentally unplugged a bend sensor while addning the springs... oh man
	Run 4: Calibration after fixing bend sensor
	Run 5: TS34 - Springs - first ~20 trials Matt was still in the rig. ~875 total
	Run 6: TS34 - No Springs - running until juice is out - about 900 trials.
	
-Notes:
Plugged in EMG connector so that arrow is towards pin 2 - incorrectly plugged in so EMG isn't really valid
