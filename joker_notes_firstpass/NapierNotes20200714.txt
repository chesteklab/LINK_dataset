-Decoders: 
	KF0: TrainOnline_Cortical_KalmanFilter_Multi('Joker','', 2, false, [2, 4], 32, 0, 1:96, good_chans_SBP, 1, {'act_thresh',1}, true);
	KF1: TrainOnline_Cortical_KalmanFilter_Multi('Joker','', 5, false, [2, 4], 32, 0, 1:96, good_chans_SBP, 1, {'act_thresh',1}, true);
	
	
-Runs:
	Run 1: TS 29 - random trials for about 150
	Run 2: TS 34 - no springs training set. About 380 trials
	Run 3: Calibration while putting the springs on. Turned off before I remembered I could calibrate while back there with him
	Run 4: Calibration while putting the springs on.
	Run 5: TS 34 - with springs
	Run 6: TS 34 - without springs - stopped at 290 because FL was dropping backets (likely because I tried to start copying data to the server)
	Run 7: TS 29 - random trials without springs - we could see how this compares to run 1. Also copying data over is taking a while so giving him something to do.
	Run 8: TS 34 - KF0 - hold times down to 500ms. Hard to control index finger to start and the fingers are pretty jittery. Online start at trial 10, ended at trial 207.
	Run 9: TS 34 - KF1 - kind of looks better than KF0. Online start at trial 10. Went to a little over 200.
	Run 10: TS 34 - KF0 - seems to have trouble extending MRP without extending index also. Switched to hand control around trial 60. Went to trial 100.
	Run 11: TS 34 - KF0 - after a 5 minute break. Really struggling to separate the fingers, mostly when MRP is more extended than index.
	Run 12: TS 34 - KF1 - 
	
	
	
Notes
	The spike panel looked like it was getting more noisey near the end.
