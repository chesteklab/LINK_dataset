-Runs:
	Run 1: Calibration
	Run 2: Warm-up
	Run 3: 400 Trials - Training
	Run 4: 100 Trials - Test
	Run 5: 250 Trials - 3k iterations (first ~5 were normal hand ctrl)
	Run 6: 6k, ignore (false start)
	Run 7: 250 trials - 6k iterations (first ~5 were normal hand ctrl)
	Run 8: Tried 250 at 3k, but was very shaky and unable to obtain many targets
	Run 9: 75 trials - 3k, high fail rate.
	Run 10: _ trials - 6k, high fail rate. Dylan suggested taking a new training set/retraining to see if there's been a change in activity.
	Run 11: 400 Trials - Training
	Run 12: 100 Trials- Testing
	Run 13: 250 trials - 3k iterations, decent amount of failures
	Run 14: 6k, got stuck
	Run 15: 6k still stuck, just leaving to go (trying to get to 250) - switched back to hand control for ~10 trials at 40. Seems to be trying
			but not succeeding often. switched back to hand control at 120 for another 10. stopped at 140
	
	
-Notes:
 - initial networks seems to stop functioning very well over time. Could be a reason why willsey spaces out everything so much?
- retraining new networks then improved performance, but probably makes sense to be taking more breaks then.
	- hard to test but could it be possible that using the network changes dynamics? 
		- look at tuning before and after? compare with normal hand control day? Idk a thought, always so many experiments possible.
- probably also just loss in motivation
-second idx was constantly more flexed.
