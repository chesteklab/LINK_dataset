- Goals: Neural Network test with no velocity redistribution

- Experiment: Sam, Matt M

- Recording Start Time: 10:40 am
- Recording Stop Time: 11:00 pm

- xPC Model: Rig_main_Cortical_Parasite
- Recorded Array: Motor (Patient Cable)
- Data recorded: Spikes (250Hz highpass, RMS -4.5) + Raw + 2kSps 300-1000HzBPas continuous
- Drink: Apple Juice

- Params: 
	* Movement Mask: [0,1,0,1,0]
	* Target Hold Time (OL/CL): 750 (training); 500 (testing)
	* Target Scaling(OL/CL): 100
	* Juice Time: 100
	* Trial Timeout: 10000
	* Auto Juice: 0
	* Target Pos Style: 29, 36
	* Visualization Style: MRP
	
-Decoders: 
	KF0: Trained in parasite using run 3
	KF1: Also trained in parasite (accidentally) using run 3

	RF0: Trained in parasite. Use run 9 - didn't work, need to debug

-Runs:
	Run 1: Calibration
	Run 2: TS 29 - about 200 trials, warmup
	Run 3: TS 29 - 400 trials for training
	Run 4: TS 29 - 100 trials for validation
	Run 5: TS 29 - NN online - can't flex MRP very well without flexing index finger
	Run 6: TS 29 - KF 0
	Run 7: TS 36 - went to do KF 0 but something crashed
	Run 8: TS 36 - accidentally trained a second model so he just ended up doing 100 trials hand control
	Run 9: TS 36 - KF0 - about 5 hand control trials to start
	Run 10: 
	Run 11: TS 36 - testing out the neural network with different offsets
	Run 12: Parasite crashed
	Run 13: TS 36 - NN online again. 370 trials online
	Run 14: TS 29 - Until he ran out of juice - about 665 trials. 
	

-Notes:
Last experiment there was a lot of noise so this time Sam: 
 -Moved reference from Ref 1 to Ref 2
 -Grounded the HDMI cable on the CPD
