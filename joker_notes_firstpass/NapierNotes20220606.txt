- Goals: Matt learning how to use the current pyBMI setup
 
- Experimenters: Matt M, Hisham

- Recording Start Time: 9:30 am
- Recording Stop Time:  11:30 am

- xPC Model: Rig_main_Cortical_Parasite
- Recorded Array: Motor (Patient Cable)
- Data recorded: Spikes (250Hz highpass, RMS -4.5) + 2kSps 300-1000HzBPas continuous
- Drink: Apple Juice

- Params: 
	* Movement Mask: [0,1,0,1,0]
	* Target Hold Time (OL/CL): 750/500
	* Target Scaling(OL/CL): 100
	* Juice Time: 100
	* Trial Timeout: 10000
	* Auto Juice: 0
   	* Target Pos Style (OL/CL): 29
	* Visualization Style: MRP
	
-Decoders:	
	- all decoders trained with tri vel redistribution, RR scaler, RNNs with 5 time history

	NN0 - willsey net, 3500 iters, 10 sec neural norm (regression gains)
	RNN0 - GRU with 10 sec neural norm

	
-Runs:
	Run 1: calibration + warmup
	Run 2: TS29 training - 500 trials. BR~4.2  #HC1#
	--- 10 min training break ---
	Run 3: xpcBinSize didn't match
	Run 4: xpc crashed
	Run 5: NN0 - MRS biased to extension. 
	Run 6: RN0 - Worked a little but then recording got noisy and fingers got stuck. He figured out how to do trials after a bit. I let him do ~500. He did them in spurts where he would figure it out, then fingers would get stuck, and then he'd figure it out again.
