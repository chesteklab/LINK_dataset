-Runs:	
	Run 1: 1000 trials TS29. Bitrate ~4.6.
	Run 2: 1000 trials TS34. Bitrate ~5. A few weird trials between 850 and 900 because the video was up.
	Run 3: 170 trials TS35. He may be out of juice, he stopped out of nowhere. Giving him a short break
	Run 4: 5 trials, just testing if he was out of juice. He was.
