-Decoders: 
	KF0: TrainOnline_Cortical_KalmanFilter_Multi('Joker','2020-02-22', 2, false, [2, 4], 50, 0, goodChans, goodChans, 1, {'act_thresh',1}, true);
	NN in NNDecode.py used was: FC4Lp05_CNN1L16N_BN
	
-Runs:
	Run 1: Calibration
	Run 2: TS34 - Hand control, 400+ trials 
	Run 3-4: garbage; user error
	Run 5: TS34 - KF0 - Using TCR; avg bit rate 1.435
	Run 6: user error
	Run 7: TS34 - NN0 - Decoder trained on a normal training data run, avg bit rate 1.1; gain 1.05/20; unintentionally was applying a 2nd order IIR filter to this test; intended to be a HPF but had not been optimized; Joker_2020-02-22_Run-002_FC4L256Np05_CNN1L16N_Gauss_TC_2800.pt
	Run 8-9: Debugging HPF; did not work, was unintentionally applying it twice
	Run 10: a few trials with SBP decode so that we can train refit, he wasn't looking at the screen
	Run 11: Adjusting gain for ReFIT NN; 
	Run 12: ReFIT NN; Joker_2020-02-22_Run-002_FC4L256Np05_CNN1L16N_Gauss_TC_2800_ReFIT.pt
	Run 13: Debugging and setting gain for new set of weights; Joker_2020-02-22_Run-002_FC4L256Np05_CNN1L16N_Gauss_TC_5600
	Run 14: tried to run with new set of weights and was terrible, then left it running for 10 min
	Run 15: weights 4600, tweaked the gain
	Joker_2020-02-22_Run-002_FC4L256Np05_CNN1L16N_Gauss_TC_4600.pt
	Run 16: weights 4600, let it run for about 100 trials, intermittent periods of no effort
	Joker_2020-02-22_Run-002_FC4L256Np05_CNN1L16N_Gauss_TC_4000.pt
	Run 17-18: played around with gain and filter parameters nothing really worked well, suspect the filter is not implemented correctly
	Run 19: Kalman filter run. Got to about 40 trials but severely effort limited. avg bit rate was about 0.6
	
-Notes: All NN tests had a poorly designed IIR filter applied to the output unintentionally; when testing the "filter" it was being applied twice.
