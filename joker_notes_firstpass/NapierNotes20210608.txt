- Goals: Error Classification Parasite Test
 
- Experiment: Dylan, Hisham, Eric

- Recording Start Time: 11:00 am
- Recording Stop Time:  1:00 pm

- xPC Model: Rig_main_Cortical_Parasite_Test
- Recorded Array: Lateral (Patient Cable)
- Data recorded: Spikes (250Hz highpass, RMS -4.5) + Raw + 2kSps 300-1000HzBPas continuous
- Drink: Apple Juice

- Params: 
	* Movement Mask: [0,1,0,1,0]
	* Target Hold Time (OL/CL): 750/500
	* Target Scaling(OL/CL): 100
	* Juice Time: 100
	* Trial Timeout: 10000
	* Auto Juice: 0
   	* Target Pos Style (OL/CL): 29
	* Visualization Style: MRS
	
-Decoders:
	KF0: TrainOnline_Cortical_KalmanFilter_Multi('Joker','',2,false,[2, 4],50,0,good_chans_SBP,good_chans_SBP,1,{'act_thresh',1},true); (optimal lag [1, 1])
	KF1: KF0 w/ 0 lag
		
-Runs:
	Run 1: Calibration
	Run 2: Training TS34 - 500+ trials
	Run 3: KF0 - online around trial 11; fairly good performance
	Run 4: Error classifier output testing 1 - ~50 trials; Saving of error classifer output working now!!!
	Run 5: Error classifier output testing 2 - ~60 trials; Trying to debug second finger issues and general classifier issues online
	Run 6: Error classifier output testing 3 - ~60 trials; Let him run in hand control while dubgging online for 700+ trials; fixed 2 finger decode issue by end
	Run 8: Error classifier output testing 4 - ~50 trials; Full output with saving Z-struct and working for both fingers (however try_data is not valid today as it is based on old data.)
	
	
-Notes:
	try_data.mat is based on old data since Miri could not make the online experiment.

	good_chans_SBP = [1:9,11,13,15,17,23,24,33,35,37:40,43,45:47,49:53,55:60,62,64,65,67:69,71:76,78:88,90:92,95,96];
