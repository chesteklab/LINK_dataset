-Runs:
	Run 1: Calibration
	Run 2: TS35 - Normal, ~750 trials
	Run 3: TS35 - Springs 2/4, ~1000 trials - accidentally disconnected bend sensor while putting in springs. Matt was in rig for first ~15 successful targets. 
	Run 4: TS35 - Normal  - ~775 trials
	Run 5: TS29 - Normal - ~500 trials
	Run 6: TS29 - Springs 2/4 - Matt was in the rig to start for the first 16 successful trials and the last 5 trials. The MRP bend sensor got unplugged while adding springs again. Index finger bend sensor is giving a noisy reading, may be that the pin holding the stanchion in place is hitting the bend sensor. Confirmed that metal dowel was hitting index bend sensor when I went back to change springs.  
	Run 7: TS29 - Normal - 500 trials - Matt was in the rig for the first 15 trials and last 5 trials. 

	
-Notes:
EMG data sets collected by Matt starting 1/8 had the EMG connector plugged in wrong before this day.
