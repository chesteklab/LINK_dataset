-Runs: where there are missing runs means there was a crash
	Run 1: calibration
	Run 2: Training TS32. 300 trials
	Run 3: Training TS34. 300 trials
	Run 4: Training TS32. 300 trials
	Run 5: KF0 SBP. Took a 10-15 minute break between run 4 and here. Index is very flexion biased, though seems to be ok after 20 or so trials. HT500 trial 30 on. Having some issues with index flexion later on. Reset decoder around trial 90. Now index is extension biased. Decoder not really working.
	Run 6: KF1 SBP. Looking better. Until index goes to full extension, has trouble getting it back. Reset decoder around 30. TS34 at 126.
	Run 7: KF2 SBP. Looking good again, we'll see how extension does. Has similar trouble with flexion after extension, but can manage. Seems about the same as KF1.
	Run 8: Collecting hand control again, TS32. Just over 250 trials.
	Run 9: TS34.
	Run 10: KF3 SBP. Has trouble flexing MRS. HT500 trial 11 after. Trying TCR trial 14. TCR working pretty well. TS34 at 166.
	Run 11: KF4 SBP. Tried SBP out first, locked to extension. TCR at trial 15. Same problem.
	Run 12: KF3 TCR: Seems to be the only one working consistently. SBP at 25 still extension biased. TCR at 26. SBP for a few trials around 290.
	Run 13: RF0 TCR: looks typical for RF. Not as high performance as a working SBP RF, but he's got good control. Switching to SBP just to see how it does. Actually working extremely well. Much better than TCR.

-Notes:
good_chans_SBP = [1,3:7,9,11,13,15,17,23,33,35,37,40,43,45:47,49:53,55:60,62,64,67:69,71:76,78:88,90:92,94]; 

Most failures today were his fingers getting stuck in extension.

I wouldn't make conclusions on this dataset, wasn't a clean day. Forgot to give Wayne some of his shots, so there was a long break in the middle.
