- Goals: 2D with parasite and simple neural network

- Experiment: Matt W, Scott

- Recording Start Time: 10:30am
- Recording Stop Time:  

- xPC Model: Rig_main_Cortical_Parasite_xPC_KF
- Recorded Array: Motor (Cereport breakout straight to FEA) and Sensory (CPE) and EMG (instrumentation amplifier to Samtec board)
- Data recorded: Spikes (250Hz highpass, RMS -4.5) + Raw + 2kSps 300-1000HzBPas continuous
- Drink: Apple Juice

- Params: 
	* Movement Mask: [0,1,0,1,0]
	* Target Hold Time (OL/CL): 750
	* Target Scaling(OL/CL): 100
	* Juice Time: 100
	* Trial Timeout: 10000
	* Auto Juice: 0
	* Target Pos Style: 32
	* Visualization Style: MRP
	
-Decoders: 
	TrainOnline_Cortical_KalmanFilter_Multi('Joker','2020-01-29', 2, false, [2,4], 50, 0, 1:96, 1:96, 0 ,0, false);
	
-Runs:
	Run 1: Calibration
	Run 2: TS34
	Run 3: running KF on xPC and parsite in parrallel. 2D WORKS! dropped hold time to 500 ms. at 230 switvhed to hand and switch back to brain at 240
	stopped for meeting
	

-Notes:
	really didnt like hand closed positions
	index kept going fully extended when not hitting a target
