-Runs:
	Run 1: Calibration
	Run 2: TS 34 - 340 trials
	Run 3: TS 34 - 415 trials
	Run 4: TS 34 - Wrist flexed - I stayed back in the rig with him because yesterday he took fingers out of the stanchion. 
	Run 5: TS 34 - I think the wrong model was loaded
	Run 6: TS 34 - KF0 - working well. Got bit rates over 2 near the end
	Run 7: TS 34 - KF1 - Started out doing as well as run 6. Around trial 160 his fingers started getting more stuck in extension.
	Run 8: TS 34 - KF0 - Can't get flexion very well. 
	Run 9: TS 34 - KF1 - got a 2 minute break. Stuck in extension - could not get through trials. Stopped at 135. 
	Run 10: TS 34 - KF0 - started slow and then started getting really good bit rates again
	Run 11: TS 34 - KF1 - a few trials to see if the good performance will keep going. Still unuseable.
