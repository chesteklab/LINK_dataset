	* Target Scaling(OL/CL): 100
	* Juice Time: 100
	* Trial Timeout: 10000
	* Auto Juice: 0
   	* Target Pos Style (OL/CL): 34
	* Visualization Style: MRS
	
-Decoders:
	KF0: TrainOnline_Cortical_KalmanFilter_Multi('Joker','',7,false,[2 4],50,0,good_chans_SBP,good_chans_SBP,1,{'act_thresh',1},0,true); (optimal lag [1, 1] - 0 lag picked) - 0.75 CC
		
-Runs:
	Run 1: Calibration
	Run 2: Bad run, VisPC not working
	Run 3: Bad run, VisPC still not working
	Run 4: Bad run, VisPC still still not working
	Run 5: Bad run, VisPC still still not working
	Run 6: Warmup TS34
	Run 7: Training TS34 - 500 trials
	Run 8: KF0 - online by trial 10; fair performance (1.8 bps), 250 trials
	Run 9: Error classifier debug test before full run to test velocity
	Run 10 Error classifier debug test before full run to test velocity
	Run 11: Error classifier debug test before full run to test velocity
	Run 12: Error classifier debug test before full run to test velocity
	Run 13: Error detection online test 1 - online by trial 10; 50 trials
	Run 14: Error classifier debug test before full run to test data size; got very long as most was hand control debugging
	
-Notes:
	good_chans_SBP = [1:9,11,13,15,17,23,24,33,35,37:40,43,45:47,49:53,55:60,62,64,65,67:69,71:76,78:88,90:92,95,96];
