-Decoders: 
	(final 3 numbers are threshNum,avgMode,intLagMs)
	KF0: TrainOnline_Cortical_KalmanFilter_Multi_MoteIntervals('Joker','',3,false,[2,4],50,0,good_chans_SBP,good_chans_SBP,1,{'act_thresh',1},true, 1,2,25);
	KF1: TrainOnline_Cortical_KalmanFilter_Multi_MoteIntervals('Joker','',3,false,[2,4],50,0,good_chans_SBP,good_chans_SBP,1,{'act_thresh',1},true, 1,2,0);
	KF2: TrainOnline_Cortical_KalmanFilter_Multi_MoteIntervals('Joker','',8,false,[2,4],50,0,good_chans_SBP,good_chans_SBP,1,{'act_thresh',1},true, 1,2,25);
	KF3: TrainOnline_Cortical_KalmanFilter_Multi_MoteIntervals('Joker','',8,false,[2,4],50,0,good_chans_SBP,good_chans_SBP,1,{'act_thresh',1},true, 1,2,0);

-Runs:
	Run 1: calibration
	Run 2: threshold setting: xpcMoteThresholds = calcOnlineMoteThresholds(20,'Joker');
	Run 3: training - 400 trials (BR = 4.4)
	Run 4: KF0 - intervals working without a bias (hold time still 750 here)
	Run 5: KF0 - (hold time 500) MInt - letting him get used to the decoder. hard time stopping at center. (BR = 0.99)
	Run 6: KF0 - SBP - ~90 trials before decode got stuck at 0 (resetting didn't help, MInt stuck too)
	Run 7: KF0 - decoder still stuck
	Run 8: more training. 400 trials. BR = 3.9
	Run 9:  KF2 - working better. ~100 MInt(BR 1.2). ~80 SBP (BR 1.3). crash
	Run 10: KF2 - ~20 SBP. ~100 MInt (BR 1.2). ~100 SBP (BR 1.4). ~100 MInt (BR 1.4!). Seemed to be getting the hang of MInt at the end
	--------
	Started new brain/emg recording for springs (turned spike threshold back to normal)
	Run 11: no springs. 370 trials.
	****Noticed stanchion had shifted slightly and wrist was slightly bent.
	Run 12: spring on MRP only. 660 trials.
	Run 13: no springs. 600 trials
	
-Notes:
	good_chans_SBP = [1:9,11,13,15,17,23,24,33,35,37:40,43,45:47,49:53,55:60,62,64,65,67:69,71:76,78:88,90:92,95,96];
	EMG recorded today isn't valid, the connector was incorrectly plugged in (arrow on the left when the missing pin was on the right at this point).
