-Runs:
	Run 1: Calibration and warm-up
	Run 2: TS 34 - Normal - 400 - accidentally had repeat after failure on
	Run 3: TS 34 - wrist flexed - 600 - made IF slightly easier because sometimes the bend sensor wasn't letting him get to target (happened 2 more times)
	Run 4: TS 34 - springs 2/4 - 800 trials - a few times IF wasn't working but i let him skip those. It started happening more throughout the run
	Run 5: TS 34 - 2 bands - 450 trials - may not be strong enough to flex index - taking many breaks with index. Let him go for 20 minutes. 
	Run 6: TS 34 - normal - 400
