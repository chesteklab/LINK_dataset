-Decoders: 
	KF0: TrainOnline_Cortical_KalmanFilter_Multi('Joker','',4,false,[2,4],32,0,goodChans,goodChans,1,{'act_thresh',1},true); % Normal 1
	KF1: TrainOnline_Cortical_KalmanFilter_Multi('Joker','',5,false,[2,4],32,0,goodChans,goodChans,1,{'act_thresh',1},true); % Spring
	KF2: TrainOnline_Cortical_KalmanFilter_Multi('Joker','',7,false,[2,4],32,0,goodChans,goodChans,1,{'act_thresh',1},true); % Normal 2
	
-Runs:
	Run 1: Calibration
	Run 2: TS 34 training - seeing if calibration is ok
	Run 3: TS 35 - hopefully to use to compare neural later. 260 trials
	Run 4: TS 34 - training 350 trials. 
	Run 5: TS 34 - with springs (large spring on MRP)
	Run 6: TS 35 - after 2 minute break - still with springs hopefully to compare neural later. About 255 trials. 
	Run 7: TS 34 - without springs, while training models
	Run 8: TS 34 - KF0 - MRP is very flexed, can't control it/can't extend MRP without also extending index. Letting him try up to 50 trials. Let him do 30-40 hand trials after to keep him happy. 
	Run 9: TS 34 - KF1 - Both fingers are very extended -> can't get down to mid. Tried TCFR instead of SBP, doesn't work either. Well works a little better, he can get targets. 
	Run 10: TS 34 - KF0 - using TCFR. Can get the targets this time. 220 trials (first few are hand control)
	Run 11: TS 34 - KF1 - using TCFR. Seemed biased towards extension to start. Can't seem to flex MRP all the way.
	Run 12: TS 34 - KF2 - using TCFR. Stopped at trial 150. Can't extend index very well. 
	Run 13: TS 34 - KF2 - using SBP. Just to see if it's better... it is much better. 120 trials
	Run 14: TS 34 - KF0 - using TCFR. Index finger was very extended when starting closed loop. 160 trials. 
	Run 15: TS 34 - KF1 - using TCFR. Both fingers very extended when starting closed loop. Stopped at about 145.

-Notes:
 		
goodChans = [1,3:7,9,11,15:19,33,35,37:41,49:51,53,58:62,65,67:69,71:76,78:88,90:92]; %These have some spiking
